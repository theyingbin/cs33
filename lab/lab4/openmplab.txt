1. Getting started with OpenMPLab
	a. First I downloaded the openmplab.tgz file from CCLE
	b. Then I extracted the files on the linux server using the following command
		$ tar -zxvf openmplab.tgz
	c. Then in the openmplab directory, I made sure the unoptimized code worked by running it with the following commands
		$ make seq
		$ ./seq
2. Optimizing func.c
	a. I first checked which function was the bottleneck by using gprof
		$ make seq GPROF=1
		$ ./seq
		$ gprof seq|less
	b. Then I made changes to func.c so it would be optimized. The changes I made are documented in func.c
	c. I then tested the speed of the new code using the following command
		$ make omp
		$ ./omp
	d. I repeat step a except I replace seq with omp and optimize accordingly
		$ make omp GPROF=1
		$ ./omp
		$ gprof omp|less
